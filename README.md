# Dependency-Analyzer
## NodeJS Dependency Analyzer

## Instructions to execute the application:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Execute with node: `node app.js`.

### Note: The app will just analyze a file named `websites.csv` within the project folder. 
#### The format should be _(name, url)_. An example file is provided.



### Problem: 
There is a list of websites in a file (websites.csv), and we need to know the js dependencies for each website. 
Websitesâ€™ html content will be available from two sources, one from the local file system and the other one using http resources.

#### Expected results:

* Retrieve the list of results containing the website name and the content length( in bytes).
* Retrieve the list of results containing the website name and the dependencies.
* Retrieve the dependencies and the frequency occurrences.

#### Front-end will be implemented in the future.
